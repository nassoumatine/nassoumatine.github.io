## Portfolio Projects  

### 1. [Sleep-Mood Research Poster](Assoumatine_CBSC185_Sleep_Mood_Poster.pdf)  
*A visual summary of how sleep affects student wellbeing*  
- Cleaned and analyzed self-reported mood/sleep data from 18 participants  
- Created accessible visualizations (regression plots, bar charts)  
- Key insight: Each extra hour of sleep improved mood scores by 0.13 units (p=0.03)  
- **Skills**: Data visualization, statistical communication  

### 2. [Sleep-Mood Longitudinal Study](Assoumatine_CBSC185_Sleep_Mood_Study.pdf)  
*Mixed-effects modeling of 243 daily survey responses*  
- Processed temporal data with missing value handling  
- Implemented linear mixed models (LMMs) in R  
- Found 23% of mood variation stems from individual differences  
- **Skills**: Longitudinal analysis, R programming, hypothesis testing  

### 3. [MNIST Classification with PyTorch](Assoumatine_CSCI315_MLP_MNIST_Analysis.pdf)  
*Deep learning for handwritten digit recognition*  
- Built and tuned MLP/SLP models achieving 80.4% accuracy  
- Compared CPU/GPU performance for hyperparameter optimization  
- Analyzed error patterns via confusion matrices  
- **Skills**: PyTorch, model evaluation, performance benchmarking
